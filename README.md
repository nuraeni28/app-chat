## Step Running The Application

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- Run the command on the terminal
```bash
$ php artisan serve
```
- Run the command on the other terminal
```bash
$ cd socket
$ node server.js
```
